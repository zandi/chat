README

chat is a very simple chat server/client, begun as an excercise in using
sockets and the basic parallel computing that stems from that.

you can compile with "gcc main.c server.c client.c", and running the
executable without any parameters gives usage.

Note that there are hard limits on username/message buffers, and the only
real feature in the client is "/quit" to quit (or ^D to send EOF)

have fun!
